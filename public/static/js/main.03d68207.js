For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn\'t even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you\'ve seen it you know what I mean).

Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don\'t know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling.

Would like a bird\'s eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I\'ll survive ha.

My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I\'m not surprised with the ILX\'s system, but how can a 2013 \\"luxury\\" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.

I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the \'16 Civic LX 6MT or the \'16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn\'t want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I\'ve come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn\'t want the Si and wasn\'t too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I\'m still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I\'ve also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I\'ve only put premium in it and honestly don\'t mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn\'t be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It\'s a pleasant convenience in it but wasn\'t a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I\'ve come to truly enjoy. If you\'re looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda\\n F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.\\nRead more"},{"field1":"28","Aspect":"safety","Label":"pos","Review":"I own the 2014 ILX base 2.0L 5-sp auto.

Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don\'t have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of \\"gliding\\" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to \\"gliding\\" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don\'t always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying \\"It is a beautiful car, it sells itself\\".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8."},{"field1":"38","Aspect":"colour","Label":"pos","Review":"I just purchased the 2015 ILX 2.4 6 speed manual and must say, this is the most fun car I\'ve ever had.

I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura\'s legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don\'t think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and \\"Build and Price\\" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn\'t the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call \\"practical luxury\\". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren\'t pleased or it didn\'t meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. \\n\\nThe only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5\'11\\" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven\'t test driven any of them).\\n\\nUPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that\'s such a first world problem I don\'t even feel good complaining about it.

I can\'t attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I\'m betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.

Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it\'s loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn\'t as luxurious and doesn\'t perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can\'t ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can\'t have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.

It\'s good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration.

However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. \\n\\nI\'ll start with the positives: The engine is good; it\'s a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it\'s working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it\'s an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.\\n\\nNow to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver\'s seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don\'t like to crank lumbar up to 11, you\'re not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you\u2019re going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there\u2019s the fact that in the best position I\u2019ve found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.\\n\\nThe rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here\u2019s the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling; leather wrap on the steering wheel; stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)\u2019 phone call quality; ease of using phone controls\u2026pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it\u2019s made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. \\n\\nSo you might think that if you don\u2019t care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren\u2019t for the issue with the driver\u2019s seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si."},{"field1":"68","Aspect":"comfort","Label":"pos","Review":"Like other Hondas I have owned in the past, this 2016 ILX has been flawless.

While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn\'t have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn\'t make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be.

Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you\'re nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. \\"Pleather\\" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you\'ll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days.

If not you\'re stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17\\" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it\'s trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it\'s higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000.

Have owned alot of HP machinery since trading my M5 in 1997 - and can honestly say I feel I\'ve given up almost nothing between the 2 cars, and the M5 cost me $48,000 in 1987 and the ILX cost me $31,000 in 2019......32 years later.

For around 32K this loaded great looking sports sedan is a blast to drive. It\'s fast enough, handles great, the steering is a perfect balance not to loose (like most new cars these days) and not too firm.  I test drove the Lexus IS, Infiniti Q-50, Audi A-3, Benz   CLA and A-class, BMW 2 and 3 series, Jaguar XE, Genesis G70 and the Volvo S60.

This go-round we decided to downsize to the ILX. I wish we didn\'t. We chose to go Acura after comparing to the Honda Civic, which wasn\'t as nice and had a much inferior engine-transmission package. But the 2019 ILX, while nice, isn\'t as nice as the TLX. Seats aren\'t as comfortable. The memory seats don\'t remember me very well. Seat heaters are either on or off, no degrees of heat. The ILX drives pretty well and if you keep the revs up can even feel a little sporty. Our biggest complaint is the size of the gas tank. It\'s barely over 10 gallons; the TLX had 17+.

Some professional reviewers get behind the wheel, floor the gas pedal, and then say it\'s noisy and not fast enough. But the truth is most drivers don\'t floor the gas in everyday driving. For a driver like myself going to work every day in a normal commute I found the car to be very quick and it also gives a quiet ride! The transmission and engine work very well together for an incredibly smooth driving experience, and both have proven long term reliability. The styling is great, and the fit and finish is quality. It\'s a very solid feeling car and mine has absolutely no squeaks or rattles. The ELS stereo system with surround sound blows me away and it\'s the best sound system I\'ve ever heard in a car. The lower touch screen is solely dedicated to the sound system with integrated pandora capability as well as XM radio. The upper screen is dedicated to navigation as well as apple car play and android auto. Reviewers like to complain about the dual screen set up, but I think it\'s great! My one and only complaint about this car is that the navigation is very dated looking, but hey it works well anyway. The best part about this car is no doubt the value for the money. Compare it to other premium brands and you will pay thousands more, and you really cannot compared it to a non premium model such as a civic because it\'s truly a cut above in fit and finish. In a way it\'s in a class all by itself. Also great is that the cost of repair and normal maintenance is nowhere near what you will pay for other premium brands. So all in all I know I made a great decision in buying the ILX and look forward to driving this fun car for many years to come."},{"field1":"108","Aspect":"transmission","Label":"pos","Review":"I first saw the ILX at the auto show near me in February and was immediately drawn in by its styling, logical controls, and price. My daily driver was a 2011 Civic at the time, which had been consistently reliable and had a nice character to it. (It\'s now my second/backup car; why get rid of a perfectly good vehicle?)\\nHonda\'s reputation for quality and reliability was the first factor in my decision to look further into this car. When I started researching it, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. Then I realized what they were comparing the car to. This isn\'t one of those cars that young people drag down the freeway. It\'s also not an Audi or Mercedes in terms of price (I even cross-shopped the Mercedes-Benz A220 along with the Honda Accord). \\nWhat this car truly represents is a step between mainstream vehicles (Accord, Camry, etc) and full-blown luxury (BMW 3 Series, Audi A4). It\'s a spot which, at one time, belonged to the Oldsmobile Cutlass. You bought a Cutlass to step up from Chevy and after you had your performance car phase with Pontiac. It wasn\'t a Cadillac, but you didn\'t need a Cadillac--just something that was a little nicer than your Malibu. Oldsmobile (and Mercury, for that matter) are long gone, so many people have trouble placing a \\"step up\\" model these days.\\nWhat the ILX gives you is a car that is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and is easy to use. Controls are often difficult to figure out on new cars; even something as simple as shifting into drive can be a challenge for someone who hasn\'t bought a new car in a while. The ILX uses traditional controls and was very easy to learn, even coming from a low-tech model like a 2011 Civic. It\'s also nice to see a car with a non-turbo engine and a regular automatic transmission rather than a CVT. You even get a CD player. Some of us appreciate the old-school touches like that, especially knowing what long term reliability and proven performance look like!\\nI have no problems with the interior materials, and I even sat in the A220 and rented an Evoque last year! The leather is high grade and the plastic, in no way, feels cheap. The steering wheel has a very nice feel to it as well.\\nThe dual screen setup, to me, is a huge perk. I worked with a similar system on an older Accord a few years back and I\'m shocked Honda seems to want to phase it out. It was easy to learn and works very well. Again, it\'s a proven winner.\\nRegarding comparisons to Civics--I have a Civic and have driven the current model. These are two entirely different vehicles in character and refinement. The Civic may have more performance options in the Si trim, but if you\'re buying the ILX, you\'re probably looking more for refinement, not to win a drag race. That\'s what this car gives you--a lot of luxury in a small package. Just because it\'s derived from the Civic doesn\'t make it a Civic. Remember, the CR-V was also derived from the Civic platform and is an entirely different vehicle. As a longtime Civic owner, I can also tell you that being related to the Civic is a good thing. Aside from age-related maintenance like a muffler and brakes, my Civic has never let me down, 145K miles later.\\nI drove an Accord as well and it\'s a similar car in terms of feel, but smaller. In fact, the ILX feels more like a small Accord with a few refinements. A comparably-equipped Accord is bigger, but $5000 more. If you don\'t consistently haul around passengers but want the luxury, go for the ILX. The Accord is a little bit quieter in terms of road noise if that matters to you, but also has a steeper learning curve with some controls.\\nTo sum this up: test-drive the ILX and see for yourself what a wonderful car it really is. I\'ve enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of mine since purchasing it and am looking forward to having it as my daily driver for a long time."},{"field1":"109","Aspect":"reliable","Label":"pos","Review":"I LOVE this Sporty Car!

I loved that car and was inclined to get the new redesigned one, but had some negative feelings about the Mazda dealership experience. Against my better judgement I looked at the Acura ILX. Let me just saw that this car is inferior to the 3 in virtually every respect, and in some ways vastly inferior. But first, the positives: the headlights! This car has the best headlights ever. They illuminate the road extremely well under any circumstances such that I hardly ever use my high beams. Next, the value: it\'s easily the cheapest \\"luxury\\"vehicle one can lease and you do get a great amount of tech for the money as long as you step up to the quite affordable premium package. Apple Carplay? Emergency braking? Lane departure warning? Sunroof? You\'ve got it! And finally, the seats. Extremely comfortable. Everyone who sits in them makes the same observation. Now, the negatives: IT\'S NOT A LUXURY CAR!!!!! Rear windows aren\'t automatic. Seriously? My Mazda had a vastly superior interior. It also had a vastly superior driving experience. Acura\'s DCT is a horrible transmission, never seeming to know which gear to be in at lower speeds. It hesitates before downshifting and flutters about annoyingly, irritating the driver and probably wasting gas. The 3 also ran circles around this car in terms of handling. The ILX does not do well in the twisties and the noises it makes and general way it behaves just does not inspire one to test its limits and push it harder. It\'s not completely awful but feels a lot more like a Toyota product, or maybe even an old Buick. Steering/handling are vague. \\nLast but not least, the heating system: the weakest I have experienced in any vehicle, period. Unacceptably bad. I will leave it at that. \\nOne may wonder why I got this car given the above. It came down to price. Truthfully, I am paying less to lease it than I paid for the Mazda. And it is very cute looking.

It was a fantastic new car on the scene. Well, 15 years later, my daughter is 15 now and learning to drive and she will inherit the MDX as her first car to drive around. It has 210K miles on it. Its mostly been trouble free. Transmission went at 129K so was out of any warranty. (Apparently the early models, including mine, used a GM transmission as Acura had not quiet gotten their transmission ready for the car, later models used Acura transmission). The transmission rebuild cost $4500 but included a special attachment to the radiator to resolve the heating problem that these transmission had. On this second transmission, the car is now at 210K miles and it looks like it would probably do another 20K-40K without much problems. Changed battery 4 times (we live mostly in hot climate). Changed Tires 4-5 times. Changed brakes twice. Three timing belt jobs. One 100K tune up. Countless air filter and oil changes. Leak in power steering fixed (twice). A/C hose replaced. Engine mounts replaced under warranty. Catalytic converter went at 160K miles...feel I have spend $6-7K on all the repairs and normal maintenance over the years including wear and tear items like Battery, Tire, Brakes , Wipers etc....that works out to less than $500 per year which is not bad at all. I feel part of the issue with car trouble is crooked dealers who try to get you to replace items which don\'t need immediate replacement. Unless its an obvious problem impacting safety and drivability don\'t replace the item unless you are convinced it needs replacing. Car still looks new after 15 years. Amazing paint job. And guess what, didn\'t like the look of the new 2014 MDX so bought a nice new Range Rover - very fancy - but after 2 years and  numerous problems, I traded it in for an UGLY but hopefully much more reliable 2016 MDX.

It sat on the lot for long time, so I picked it up for $6,000.  It was cosmetically beat up, but I wasn\'t afraid to own it as I have the greatest independent Japanese Auto mechanic.  He said it was mechanically sound.   I\'m retired, so I\'ve had time to upgrade:  Suspension, Running Boards, Catalytic Converters, all  LED Lights, Window Regulator, Starter, all dents removed,  reupholstered front seat bottoms myself. It now looks and drives really nice!   It now has 173,000 miles and I\'ve spent a total of $5,000 in maintenance repairs and upgrades.  This SUV hums along like a Japanese Clock!  This is my 3rd MDX of this series (2001 to 2006). Frankly, I occasionally think of getting something sexier or newer, but you just cannot beat the reliability and comfort of this vehicle. Plus, the interior of this SUV is huge.  The newer ones were reduced in size and I don\'t like the style as much.   I know that my honest mechanic will keep me on the road no matter what. However,  I recommend that everyone should buy  a OBD2 scanner, learn to read codes and research fixes on Youtube.    From what I\'ve read,  I know that a transmission may be in my future.  But,  I\'m not worried, as I know a great transmission guy.  At the price I\'ve paid for this car,  I can afford a transmission.  Oh, the AWD is excellent in ice and snow.  I run Bizzaks  on spare wheels in the winter and it never gets stuck.  All round great vehicle and I would drive it anywhere.  Wish gas mileage was better, but then what SUV gets great mileage?

Also make sure to get the timing belt replaced at the regular intervals, this is an interference engine and the valves will bend if the belt breaks. Great sound system, great room, great comfort, and usability. Buy this car if your in the market for an older luxury SUV with a lot of life left in it!

Can not believe I had to order and pay for body side mouldings extra.  If you tow anything over 4,500 pounds you will not be able to do it with the MDX.

One of the reasons I bought the MDX is because I wanted better gas mileage than my previous guzzling LX470 - but mileage is way below advertised, and not much better than the much bigger and heavier V8 powered LX470.

Sound deadening is better than any Honda/Acura I\'ve ever owned.  Seats are comfortable--I had to drive 12 hours stopping only for gas and felt fine.
