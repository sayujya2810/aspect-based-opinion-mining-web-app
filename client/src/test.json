    "Review": "I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats."

I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."

As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!"

    "Review": "In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car."

    "Review": "My previous car was a leased 2015 Civic EX-L, but due to a job change I needed to get out of my lease mileage restrictions. I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price."

    "Review": "I helped m Grandma buy a CPO 2013 ILX w/ Tech. package.  She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 \"luxury\" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic."

Every other gear is designed to keep you from the gas pump and they do. The ILX handles incredible well, takes corners with ease and brakes suddenly when needed. Keep your stereo loud, as you want to drown out the road noise. The interior is sharply designed , but does so with less than stellar Lego material. Looks great, just don't touch anything...kills the illusion. I have never experienced any mechanical failure...not one. I still have great braking left after 67,000 miles. I keep taking my car in, thinking the mechanics who inspect my car, forget to check the brakes. The cars design is fantastic. When another car passes me, as they usually do, they stare at the car or is it me, for moving too slow? Overall, I would buy this again without hesitation. No car has made me laugh so hard with the look of speed and the resiliency to keep me pleased. I do really like this car...just please put the rest of the gears in next time."

The upgraded sound system is better than I would expect in this class of car.  There are a few minor drawbacks to the car, but based on the price point, you have to expect some trade offs.  First, the 150hp engine is sufficient for 80% of situations, but it’s definitely underpowered.  Get the optional 200hp engine if you can (I think in newer models they made it standard).  I have driven a 2018 with the 200hp, and it makes a huge difference.  Second, there are no memory seat buttons.  I didn’t think this would be a big deal when I was car shopping, but I realized quickly that I used memory seats way more often than I thought.  Then again, I’m someone who is overly sensitive to a seat position that’s slightly off from what I’m used to!   It would be nice if they made this model in AWD, but snow traction is about as decent as you can find without all wheel drive."

    "Review": "I was looking for a good commuter with a manual transmission I could hold on to of the next 15 years. I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda\n F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.\nRead more"

However, I ended up taking a test drive because manual transmission cars have become hard to find, and they were giving big discounts.  After a test drive though, I realized that this car was something special, and the more I drive it the more I like it.  I'm happy to say that this car has a much higher fun factor than I originally expected.  The clutch and transmission are just a pure joy to use.  It's definitely the nicest manual transmission I've ever had, including multiple VWs, a Saab, and multiple Subarus.  The engine also loves to rev and has a wonderful sound for a 4 cyl.  It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.  However, if you are OK with the normal noise levels found in Hondas/Acuras, this is a great choice for a little sporty car!"

Suspension is not too taut like a sports car, but not overly soft. Steering is typical Honda light, but also responsive. Great handling for FWD. Also, super LIGHT car with consistent 30 mpg.\n\nOther than power, it has everything I could ask for in an entry luxury sedan."

    "Review": "I recently purchased an ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."

From a quality to price standpoint, this is VERY hard to beat. I looked at Chevy's, Toyota's, even the Mazda 3 and 6, all similar price points. The quality inside and lines out, make this look like and feel like a much more respectable and high quality ride. What car would you rather show up in at a clients house? What car would you rather trust with a child inside? LCD screen is VERY small BUT the trunk holds 2 sets+ of golf clubs. It rides very smooth, seats adjust easily, the interface is user friendly with simple buttons"

I really enjoy owning my ILX.  The ILX offers a great value.  For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17\" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.  On the highway you don't even realize you have hit 80 because it is pretty smooth.  Road noise is the only downfall, but when you are listening to the great stereo you don't hear a thing.   If you read some reviews I think they are unfair, the car is excellent.  I test drove the Audi A3 1.8T and the turbo and love the ILX by far."

    "Review": "Before purchasing this car, I had a Mazda RX-8 which I had owned for 9 years.  I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest \"want\" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of \"gliding\" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to \"gliding\" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying \"It is a beautiful car, it sells itself\".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8."

    "Review": "This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and \"Build and Price\" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call \"practical luxury\". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. \n\nThe only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11\" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).\n\nUPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well."

    "Review": "This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.  You have to read between the lines."

Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart; but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.\n\nConsidering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category."

Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.\n\nPros:\nGreat value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.\n\nCons:\nTransmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it."

I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  \nCON:\nIf you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).

Lack of lumbar support\n3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.\n4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.\n5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!\n\nThe Good parts:\n1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!\n2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.\n3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.\n4. Cost & maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!\nThe german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.\n5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.\n\nThe problems I've faced with mine:\n1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.\n2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.\n3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash & tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!\nI would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!"

Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it's loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn't as luxurious and doesn't perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can't ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can't have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.  The Premium with Blind Spot, cross traffic alert, real Milano leather, and the two tier screen system are worth every penny."

The 2016 feels much more premium and is quieter on the road.  The suspension feels tighter and more solid.  The exterior refresh is quite nice; it gives it a sportier look, but still looks like a luxury vehicle.  The greatest attribute of this car is the 8 speed duel clutch transmission, that is paired with the 2.4L engine.  The K24 is already a seasoned and beloved motor and this new 8 speed DCT is incredible.  The shifts are smooth, quick, and the rev-match down shifting is addicting.  This truly is the best compromise between an automatic and manual transmission.  This is my sister's car, which already has 47,000 miles on it and no problems have occurred.  That is no surprise, as my dad has an 09 TSX with 95k(never using the required premium gas) and never a repair once.  My father is now eyeing to replace his TSX with the ILX A-Spec and I too, will now be in the market for one, as well."

I need a small compact 4 doors vehicle since I'm a family man with two kids. I looked at the Civics, the Accords. But they just blah and not exciting in terms of styling. Plus. I didn't want to be like 80% of the car out there on the road, so many of them. From teeny boppers, grandma's, Grandpa, to your soccer moms. No thanks. \n\nSo there it is, I got the 2016 Acura ILX with premium/Aspec package. Honestly, its not really an upgrade from my RSX. Everything about this car feel cheap and could be better. Feels like they are rushing it. The gears always shifting. It can never stay in one gear long, it always shift to make sure the gears are highest fuel economy at the current speed. It's good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration. Coming from a cable, maybe it have to do with the new electric drive by wire, who knows but its really annoying when you need that quick acceleration. Now on the other hand, the Dual Clutch mode is awesome, stellar and works perfectly. I think that pretty much the only part of the car that stands out. Very responsive, smooth gear transition from downshift and up shift. The steering is numb and you don't feel that much road feed back. The handling is good. Not much body roll. The car puts me to sleep. I need some excitement, the thrill of a screaming VTEC kicking in. Instead I got a very boring tone. The seat doesnt have much bolster to snug you in. I feel Acura lost touch with its racing heritage. My other pet peeve is the head room, I'm 5'11\" but it really cramp in there. Only about in of space left from the ceiling to my head.  I will probably pass this car to my wife in a few more years and get myself a stick shift car. \n\nIf you like driving like grandma, just chill, relax, cruising and looking good in it.

After looking at all the entry level luxury vehicles, I decided on the Acura ILX. My situation is, I wanted economical luxury. I wanted a car I could drive until the wheels fell off. I wanted a car that I didn't have to make difficult appointments for to get serviced or maintained. I didn't want to worry about what service needed to be done when the service due light came on....a burden I had driving the mini. For me, this car works great! I bought the premium package in black right around when they launched the 2016's... Drove it for a year and realized I had made a huge mistake. Black is a horrible color to keep clean when you commute and don't park in a garage! So when I took my car in today for its second ever service, I was somehow made an offer I couldn't refuse on a brand new white premium with ASPEC. There is a major difference between the two. I love the ASPEC seats and odometer and foot pedals. The front looks less like a beak! I'm so glad I upgraded! Maintence is painless and affordable! No stress car for younger commuter! I'm happy!\n\n***update 1 year later.  This car is a great commuter and is so easy for me to get serviced. No hassle ! I'm so glad I got a white car because I think I only washed it 4 times in a year! I'm driving the heck out of it and it's great!  Only complaint is the scraping if you exit a driveway or take a dip too fast.. you must be very very slow since the front end sits kind of low. Other than that, no complaints so far!"

The upgraded interior is also really nice and the seats have a nice sporty feel to them.  The acceleration for this 200 hp engine is tremendous.  Okay, so I also drive my 013 Toyota Tacoma so getting into the ILX is like getting into my own sports car.  I like the sound of the engine and I like the feel of the road.  We also own a 014 Acura RDX and it drives like a charm.  My only tiny complaint is I wish Acura would make a coupe the size of the new TLX or the ILX.\n\nUpdated review....Still fun to drive, just not as fun as I first thought\nThe 8 speed transmission lags when extra speed is needed. Also, the transmission kinda jerks when it is down-shifting and then I need to punch it to accelerate. Also there is a rattle that just drives me crazy. It is a fun car to drive. I'm not sure I will buy another ILX. Who knows."

After 300K+ miles and 11 years, I gave my old 2004 TSX to my son who is still driving it. \nI decided to lease a new 2016 ILX after Acura did the redesign of the exterior and put back the peppy and quick VR4 that was in my TSX. \nOn the plus side, the car is just like the TSX: great handling, terrific on corners and curves, super reliable, solid feel, awesome braking, beautiful long drive on the road touring vehicle, takes 5 passengers around town comfortably with room for luggage, and gets lots of compliments on the styling and interior design. Gas mileage is okay - but not the 29 mpg average promised. Only getting 27 consistently when 1-2 passengers, much less with a full car. \nOn the minus side, I wish the car was like the TSX: the dual screen technology seems redundant and is very distracting compared to the single touch screen the TSX had, the acceleration is hesitant - the car seems to 'think' about moving faster before it actually goes into gears. Gas mileage sucks in city driving. Freeway is 31mpg only, not the 35mpg promised. UPDATE after 1 Year: Exterior pain gets stained easily. Design flaw. Looks like the clear coat is easily damaged by on road flying liquids. \nOVERALL: Great car, just wish Honda/Acura had not removed the 'fun' and 'simple' aspect of the TSX. Sadly, sometimes I want to take back my old TSX from my son and give him the ILX...."

    "Review": "Was talked into buying a 2016 ILX certified pre-owned with 2,000 miles and it was the best life decision I have made.  Premium  (leather pwr pass /drvr seats, etc.) Acura Watch Plus fully loaded (not A Spec) with 100,000 bumper to bumper, free roadside assistance, those expensive rubber trunk/floor mats,and 7 complimentary oil changes /tire rotations for $27,000 and 0% financing.  It handles like my old 1997 A4 Quattro 6 speed and not like the over priced, poorly designed, bastard-driving Audi's-BMWs-Mercs of this generation.  I used the paddle shifters to easily drive through icy conditions and felt incredibly safe.  It corners as well as my old A4, looks great, and with the Acura Watch Plus, I feel safer than I did in my large SUV.  Use your turn signal and the car tells you everything around you.  Forget about the turn signal light on the side mirrors, you don't need it.   Rear camera, lane departure, adaptive cruise, brake warning, BLIS, all standard with the Acura Watch Plus.  The best part is the driver can not only manually enable and disable, but also modify the settings for almost each feature.  Couldn't do that with the Volvo, Audi, BMW or Merc I test drove.  Got a job in LA and drove this car I-40 from NC to CA and at one point on cruise control, I looked down and the meter registered 500 miles before empty.  Normal city driving is usually closer to 350 miles per tank. Cruising at 90+ felt like 55...so watch the speedometer.  The nav system takes about 20 seconds to register once you start the car, but it got me through 2500 miles and not one wrong turn.  It even automatically reset the time zones for me.  I knew exactly where I was all the time.  The complaints about its awkwardness is probably from some professional reviewer who was paid by Volvo. The bluetooth is clean and clear and Siri sync works 99.5% of the time if only Apple would update software more often.  If I had to complain, the pass through is right at the wheel house, so it narrows and you lose about 12 inches of space where the seat drops.  But I was still able to load the trunk with two 40\" LED TVs with oops I forget to pack this in the moving van room to spare.  People are really impressed with its comfort and style.  I drove 2500 miles in 3 days and the seat was incredibly comfortable.   Best part is I laugh when I pull up to get gas and all the PREMIUM UNLEADED people watch their $$$ pour right into their tank.  My 1997 Audi was great, but when it needed repairs $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  and $$.   I've owned American muscle cars and European sport sedans and a crappy Nissan Maxima swearing I would NEVER buy a Japanese car again.  This Acura is the best car I've EVER owned and I know I will easily and safely get over 100,000 or miles out of it.  Shhhh... don't let the secret get out."

    "Review": "I bought this car because after test driving it reminded me of my '07 Civic Si, which I sold to go back to school, only a bit more refined. However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. \n\nI'll start with the positives: The engine is good; it's a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it's working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it's an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.\n\nNow to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver's seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don't like to crank lumbar up to 11, you're not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you’re going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there’s the fact that in the best position I’ve found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.\n\nThe rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here’s the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling; leather wrap on the steering wheel; stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)’ phone call quality; ease of using phone controls…pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it’s made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. \n\nSo you might think that if you don’t care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren’t for the issue with the driver’s seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si."

I live in the city, but most of my work commute is on the highway.  I am a stickler for gas mileage and this car does not disappoint. It routinely gets over 40 mpg on the highway, averages 36 in mixed driving, and has never clocked less than 31 mpg (winter) on a tank of gas.

Latter is too big and hated the push buttons (had those on my teenage car and not going back!), car also too big.  Fit is OK, but feels like I'm downgrading from old Acura.  HR-V was OK, but don't want an SUV.  Finishes on interiors of Honda & Acura products really cheaped out now.  Still looking for something to replace this Acura ILX.

You can only dial numbers that are stored in your speed dial other than that you are having to use your phone to dial numbers. While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn't have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn't make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be. I feel as though for this car to be as expensive as it is that this Siri radio should have come along with it. But no it's a basic radio station with speakers that are not loud at all and there's no touchscreen to do anything. This is by far the worst car I've bought and wish I would have kept my Hyundai Elantra which features on the inside were so much better than this Acura and I paid 10 - 15 G less. I've contacted Acura numerous of times with only to be told that this will go in a file for my complaints. I sure wish  they would give me another car with the features that are  basic in other cars or buy this one back. This is a $30,000 car and I am so disappointed in it . I advised them that I would sell them this car back in a heartbeat and now I'm stuck with an expensive car with basic features and a High car payment. So definitely think twice about buying the ILX because you will really be disappointed in the features that they offer you in such an expensive body.\nReview: nothing has changed for the better. No room in car and I've almost received ticket due to having my phone in hand for trying to make a phone call because the Calling system in the car is poorly done.  I've call the company and they still have not tried to rectify my problem or even offer me a better car from my money. Their attitude is oh well. They may would have helped me If I was of political or entertainment status."

It is laid out nicely but storage is the least I've seen in any other car. console compartment is small and cheap feeling and the door storage can fit a tennis ball??\nMy main compmaint is a general one with the CVT transmission on ANY car. It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse \nOver al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars. I just want to actually enjoy the driving experience. Acura is only better than Honda of you can spend over $30K. The Civic is a superior car to the ILX and less expensive.

There was a brake defect where the brakes kept squeaking and after the rotors were replaced once and pads twice, the issue came back.  I think a recall will come at some point, but I was not going to wait because I was very disappointed.  The other Acura's I have owned have been great, I was very surprised that this car was released with this issue.  I traded it for a Mazda CX-3 and it is more fun to drive and and feels more powerful then the Acura.   The other issue with the Acura I noticed was the engine hum, it actually bothered my ears when I had the windows open.  The 2014 Acura ILX I had I liked better overall after owning this one for 3 months.  Before purchasing ask the dealership to give you one of their loaner cars that has a few miles on it and make sure you like driving it in everyday driving.  I would recommend buying a used 2013-2015 ILX instead.  Or a Mazda 3, I think the Mazda 3 GT would be more fun to drive everyday than the Acura."

Most modern vehicles have electric steering (ugh) and McPherson struts or something similar.  The double wishbone is gone for the most part.  HOWEVER, although this car is different, it is still a lot of fun to drive.  It handles extremely well with a lot of horsepower for its size.  The steering is good for electric and there is good feedback.  This is he first automatic I have owned in many decades of driving.  My advice: put it in sport mode, step on the gas and look for some winding roads.  You won't regret it!\n\nMarch 2018.  It is 7 months on and there has not been a single problem with this vehicle.  It handles pretty well in the snow.  It handles well on wet pavement. It is nimble and very quick on dry pavement. I drive in comfort mode to commute and it responds very well when I need to merge into traffic.  CR rated the ride poor, but I don't find it so.  I think it is perfect for a \"sport sedan\".  I've hit a few very bad potholes with no serious side effects. Two minor complaints: the armrests are too low and there is no dome light.

Back in 2007 with my first new Acura, the TSX was with navi or not, and came fully loaded with all the other features and was tons of fun to drive, especially in the twisties (mine was a 6 speed manual). Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you're nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. \"Pleather\" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you'll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days. If you want a touch screen entertainment system you'll pony up $2,000 for the premium package and also get some nick-nack features like perforated leather and blind spot detection. If not you're stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17\" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it's trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it's higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000. Truthfully it really is just a very comfortable, better looking Civic that you can lease for under $300 a month with $0 down, however, it may be the best thing you can get for that price in the luxury market."

The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle."

I loved each and every one of these cars...except this one. I HATE it. There should be a warning sign on these- \"Watch out! Buy this if you're a dummy.\" The \"new\" 8 gear transmission, with two clutches, is way too complex and does not offer performance as Acura bills it. The car hunts for gears as you accelerate, and has very little power from 10mph to 40 mph when you are accelerating. The car lugs in the lower gears. My previous car, a 2014 Acura ILX was perfection itself. I should have kept it. The most annoying aspect of this new car? The muffler. Acura is apparently ignoring its traditional (loyal) adult audience and seeking to attract new users that are young men in their 20's. So they have \"boosted\" the HP, but this is not accurate. The car is much less powerful than before, despite the claims for higher HP. And it is supposed to be thriftier on gas, but so far (I now have a little under 2000 miles) it is not as much of a gas-saver as was my 2014 Acura ILX.  The worst thing? The muffler. It is noisy as all get-out. I suppose this was to attract those young males. I would do anything to get a different muffler that is quiet. I do not wish to hear the constant \"throaty growl\" Acura has decided is necessary.  I keep thinking 33 tortured months to go...Arrgh."

I was told that I was confusing the car when I drove it.  After all, it's a sensitive transmission.  What a piece of junk.  It's a hard ride and very noisy as well.  They cut every corner they could on this car and it shows.  They didn't cut the price either.  What is standard options on so many other cars now, you pay dearly for on an Acura.  I will never, ever purchase another Acura.  Never!"

Transmission sometimes sounds and feels as if it will fall out of the car.  Sometimes hunts for a gear.  Love both the exterior and interior colors.  Trunk door drips water into the trunk when opened during or after it rains.  Mileage is acceptable.  Not great.  Brakes are outstanding for street use.  Somewhere Honda lost sight of the \"performance\" part of Acura.  Advertising the NSX does not relate to the rest of the line up.  Ovrpriced!  Under performing!"

    "Review": "I always admired this car when I saw it driving or parked. So I went to the dealer to test drive it. I was impressed with acceleration, steering feel, handling and overall ride. The interior is not luxurious but it has a sporty upscale aura to it.  The exterior lines and design also look quite sporty . I ended up leasing it for much less than the competition (Audi A3, BMW 3 series, Mercedes Benz CLA, Lexus IS, Infiniti Q50 among others) .Overall it's a fun car to drive and I feel like it offers a great value in the crowded and very competitive  entry level compact sedan category.  The base offers everything I wanted- A  peppy 2.4 /201 HP engine (more than some of the more expensive competitors), moon roof, heated leatherette seats , power drivers seats, heated mirrors , rain sensing wipers, steering wheel controls for Bluetooth, audio , cruise and more......  If you want more options like navigation, safety features and various other upgrades the payment rises accordingly , but still less than every other competitor. I also test drove mainstream compact sedans such as the Honda Civic , Nissan Sentra and Mazda 3 all drove terrific as well but the prices were too close to the more powerful Acura ILX."

The reason for that is I got my hands on a 2014 Acura TSX Tech package with 29k miles, black/black. The car had one owner, clean CarFax, certified, and Acura dealer maintained.\n\nI would say finding a 5-year-old car with all that is a rare find. I love having another TSX and the reliability, handling, and quality puts the ILX to shame. Having said all that the ILX was a fantastic car, and I do miss certain things, such as the push start, and peppy engine. I would still highly recommend it to anyone in the market."

So why not buy the Civic?  Because the 9th Generation Civic was a tried and true model which was extremely reliable (read the reviews on the current 10th Generation Civic).  Additionally, you get a VTEC engine instead of the much reported problematic Earth Dreams engine (read about fuel & oil issues), a dual-clutch transmission instead of the expensive to repair CVT transmission, and new refined styling unlike the love it/hate it polarizing Civic styling.   In a nutshell, you get a very reliable Honda Civic Si without the reported problematic components, which is dressed in a fancy new tuxedo with nicer paint and a better warranty.  A wolf in sheep's clothing."

I've read the Reviews which mostly pan this car as a \"warmed-over 9th Gen Civic\" - take it from a past owner - this is NO Civic - it has Honda reliability with the tried and proven 2.4L NON-Turbo engine and a really great Dual-clutch 8 Speed Auto. As a Manual Fan I can say this DC Auto is really nice and I'm not missing the Manuals anymore. To give some factual and real-world comparisons based on experience and facts - I bought a new 87 BMW M5 sedan in 1987 - owned it for 10 years and 65,000 miles. If you'll check for yourselves you'll see that the exterior dimensions are almost exactly the same as this ILX - M5 was 256HP (inline 6) with 5-speed Manual where ILX is 201HP (inline 4) - M5 weighed 3450 lbs - ILX weighs 3144. M5 did 0-60 in 6.7 sec - ILX does 0-60 in 6.6 sec. The above are facts, not opinions. Have owned alot of HP machinery since trading my M5 in 1997 - and can honestly say I feel I've given up almost nothing between the 2 cars, and the M5 cost me $48,000 in 1987 and the ILX cost me $31,000 in 2019......32 years later. Don't believe the reports - this ILX A-Spec may be the Sleeper of the Quarter-Century. It's admittedly not \"today's fast\" but it sure is fast enough for me.................."

We chose to go Acura after comparing to the Honda Civic, which wasn't as nice and had a much inferior engine-transmission package. But the 2019 ILX, while nice, isn't as nice as the TLX. Seats aren't as comfortable. The memory seats don't remember me very well. Seat heaters are either on or off, no degrees of heat. The ILX drives pretty well and if you keep the revs up can even feel a little sporty. Our biggest complaint is the size of the gas tank. It's barely over 10 gallons; the TLX had 17+. Where my wife had to the fill the TLX once every 6 weeks, the ILX barely makes three."

    "Review": "Before purchasing this car, I did a TON of reading both professional and consumer reviews as well as watching YouTube review videos. Some professional reviewers get behind the wheel, floor the gas pedal, and then say it's noisy and not fast enough. But the truth is most drivers don't floor the gas in everyday driving. For a driver like myself going to work every day in a normal commute I found the car to be very quick and it also gives a quiet ride! The transmission and engine work very well together for an incredibly smooth driving experience, and both have proven long term reliability. The styling is great, and the fit and finish is quality. It's a very solid feeling car and mine has absolutely no squeaks or rattles. The ELS stereo system with surround sound blows me away and it's the best sound system I've ever heard in a car. The lower touch screen is solely dedicated to the sound system with integrated pandora capability as well as XM radio. The upper screen is dedicated to navigation as well as apple car play and android auto. Reviewers like to complain about the dual screen set up, but I think it's great! My one and only complaint about this car is that the navigation is very dated looking, but hey it works well anyway. The best part about this car is no doubt the value for the money. Compare it to other premium brands and you will pay thousands more, and you really cannot compared it to a non premium model such as a civic because it's truly a cut above in fit and finish. In a way it's in a class all by itself. Also great is that the cost of repair and normal maintenance is nowhere near what you will pay for other premium brands. So all in all I know I made a great decision in buying the ILX and look forward to driving this fun car for many years to come."

    "Review": "I first saw the ILX at the auto show near me in February and was immediately drawn in by its styling, logical controls, and price. My daily driver was a 2011 Civic at the time, which had been consistently reliable and had a nice character to it. (It's now my second/backup car; why get rid of a perfectly good vehicle?)\nHonda's reputation for quality and reliability was the first factor in my decision to look further into this car. When I started researching it, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. Then I realized what they were comparing the car to. This isn't one of those cars that young people drag down the freeway. It's also not an Audi or Mercedes in terms of price (I even cross-shopped the Mercedes-Benz A220 along with the Honda Accord). \nWhat this car truly represents is a step between mainstream vehicles (Accord, Camry, etc) and full-blown luxury (BMW 3 Series, Audi A4). It's a spot which, at one time, belonged to the Oldsmobile Cutlass. You bought a Cutlass to step up from Chevy and after you had your performance car phase with Pontiac. It wasn't a Cadillac, but you didn't need a Cadillac--just something that was a little nicer than your Malibu. Oldsmobile (and Mercury, for that matter) are long gone, so many people have trouble placing a \"step up\" model these days.\nWhat the ILX gives you is a car that is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and is easy to use. Controls are often difficult to figure out on new cars; even something as simple as shifting into drive can be a challenge for someone who hasn't bought a new car in a while. The ILX uses traditional controls and was very easy to learn, even coming from a low-tech model like a 2011 Civic. It's also nice to see a car with a non-turbo engine and a regular automatic transmission rather than a CVT. You even get a CD player. Some of us appreciate the old-school touches like that, especially knowing what long term reliability and proven performance look like!\nI have no problems with the interior materials, and I even sat in the A220 and rented an Evoque last year! The leather is high grade and the plastic, in no way, feels cheap. The steering wheel has a very nice feel to it as well.\nThe dual screen setup, to me, is a huge perk. I worked with a similar system on an older Accord a few years back and I'm shocked Honda seems to want to phase it out. It was easy to learn and works very well. Again, it's a proven winner.\nRegarding comparisons to Civics--I have a Civic and have driven the current model. These are two entirely different vehicles in character and refinement. The Civic may have more performance options in the Si trim, but if you're buying the ILX, you're probably looking more for refinement, not to win a drag race. That's what this car gives you--a lot of luxury in a small package. Just because it's derived from the Civic doesn't make it a Civic. Remember, the CR-V was also derived from the Civic platform and is an entirely different vehicle. As a longtime Civic owner, I can also tell you that being related to the Civic is a good thing. Aside from age-related maintenance like a muffler and brakes, my Civic has never let me down, 145K miles later.\nI drove an Accord as well and it's a similar car in terms of feel, but smaller. In fact, the ILX feels more like a small Accord with a few refinements. A comparably-equipped Accord is bigger, but $5000 more. If you don't consistently haul around passengers but want the luxury, go for the ILX. The Accord is a little bit quieter in terms of road noise if that matters to you, but also has a steeper learning curve with some controls.\nTo sum this up: test-drive the ILX and see for yourself what a wonderful car it really is. I've enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of mine since purchasing it and am looking forward to having it as my daily driver for a long time."

    "Review": "I was leasing a Mazda3 premium plus. I loved that car and was inclined to get the new redesigned one, but had some negative feelings about the Mazda dealership experience. Against my better judgement I looked at the Acura ILX. Let me just saw that this car is inferior to the 3 in virtually every respect, and in some ways vastly inferior. But first, the positives: the headlights! This car has the best headlights ever. They illuminate the road extremely well under any circumstances such that I hardly ever use my high beams. Next, the value: it's easily the cheapest \"luxury\"vehicle one can lease and you do get a great amount of tech for the money as long as you step up to the quite affordable premium package. Apple Carplay? Emergency braking? Lane departure warning? Sunroof? You've got it! And finally, the seats. Extremely comfortable. Everyone who sits in them makes the same observation. Now, the negatives: IT'S NOT A LUXURY CAR!!!!! Rear windows aren't automatic. Seriously? My Mazda had a vastly superior interior. It also had a vastly superior driving experience. Acura's DCT is a horrible transmission, never seeming to know which gear to be in at lower speeds. It hesitates before downshifting and flutters about annoyingly, irritating the driver and probably wasting gas. The 3 also ran circles around this car in terms of handling. The ILX does not do well in the twisties and the noises it makes and general way it behaves just does not inspire one to test its limits and push it harder. It's not completely awful but feels a lot more like a Toyota product, or maybe even an old Buick. Steering/handling are vague. \nLast but not least, the heating system: the weakest I have experienced in any vehicle, period. Unacceptably bad. I will leave it at that. \nOne may wonder why I got this car given the above. It came down to price. Truthfully, I am paying less to lease it than I paid for the Mazda. And it is very cute looking. People tell me that all the time."

LED Lights are bright plus it has many of the safety collision warning features.. As for the build quality my impression is it's poor. Hood uses a metal rod for support, no shock/stay hood lift. Floor mats are very poor quality, Walmart's cheapies at least have rubber backing. There's NO SPARE TIRE! Instead they give you a small air compressor. NO jack or lug wrench but it has wheel locks. So when your sidewall blows or your flat has a hole bigger than a finish nail ensure you have someone who can bring you a new tire! Or be smart remove the foam parts holder where the spare goes and buy a temporary spare and scissor w/lug wrench and put it in it's place.

It was a fantastic new car on the scene. Well, 15 years later, my daughter is 15 now and learning to drive and she will inherit the MDX as her first car to drive around. It has 210K miles on it. Its mostly been trouble free. Transmission went at 129K so was out of any warranty. (Apparently the early models, including mine, used a GM transmission as Acura had not quiet gotten their transmission ready for the car, later models used Acura transmission). The transmission rebuild cost $4500 but included a special attachment to the radiator to resolve the heating problem that these transmission had. On this second transmission, the car is now at 210K miles and it looks like it would probably do another 20K-40K without much problems. Changed battery 4 times (we live mostly in hot climate). Changed Tires 4-5 times. Changed brakes twice. Three timing belt jobs. One 100K tune up. Countless air filter and oil changes. Leak in power steering fixed (twice). A/C hose replaced. Engine mounts replaced under warranty. Catalytic converter went at 160K miles...feel I have spend $6-7K on all the repairs and normal maintenance over the years including wear and tear items like Battery, Tire, Brakes , Wipers etc....that works out to less than $500 per year which is not bad at all. I feel part of the issue with car trouble is crooked dealers who try to get you to replace items which don't need immediate replacement. Unless its an obvious problem impacting safety and drivability don't replace the item unless you are convinced it needs replacing. Car still looks new after 15 years. Amazing paint job. And guess what, didn't like the look of the new 2014 MDX so bought a nice new Range Rover - very fancy - but after 2 years and  numerous problems, I traded it in for an UGLY but hopefully much more reliable 2016 MDX. New 2001 MDX touring bought for $37K in California in 2001. New 2016 MDX Base model bought for $39K in Texas in 2016...which was $5K off the MSRP due to up coming model change over."

I thought despite a couple of annoying short comings of the first model year, that I'd have it for years to come, but no longer. AC hose replacement at 60K miles/ $1K. Power steering 83K mi/ $600. Transmission 84K mi/ $6000. Nav system & CD multi disc changer both broken.  People still think it looks like a new car. I got several good years out of it, but for a Honda, this last year's reliability has been horrible. It should have lasted longer before the cost to repair was higher than the value. I may never go back."

This was very intermittent and the local dealer was unable to replicate the problem. The problem has gradually gotten worse. With 77,000 miles on the car I finally discovered the transmission needed replacing. Acura ¨customer service¨ informed me I would only have to pay $1180 of the $3800 repairs.

I bought it for reliability thinking I would get the regular 200,000+ miles experience and barely got 100,000. This would have been my second transmission in 2 years if not for selling it off.

If you want the ability to haul kids all around town in a safe, AWD SUV, but don't want a Yukon or Expedition, then this is the rig for you.

Then the probs w the tranny started. Thank God I bought it certified. 100 mi before expiration they replaced it free, but right at 12 mos later it's crapping again. I feel like my spouse cheated on me. For something I love to cause me this much pain, I'll never buy another Acura. To fix it will cost more than I owe it. They may  have gotten better, but they lost me for good this time.  The RL was bad enough when I replaced the window motor on 3 windows and at 105k the engine died. Can you tell I'm bitter? Sorry, i don't want to be."

About 11 months into owning the car I got a check engine light and flashing D5 light. Took it to the Acura dealer. Trans DEAD!!! They replaced it for free since it was under warranty and gave me a loaner while they did it. So then about 2 years ago I notice the trans slamming into gear. Changed fluid....same crap. So October 2014 D4 blinking light and check engine light AGAIN!!! Car would not switch out 4th gear. I took it to a trans place and had the trans totally rebuilt new Valve body, PC, gears and synchros. The builder took pics of the trans it was HORRIBLE all burned up and stuff. So what Honda does is place the trans cooler into the Rad so I have no idea how but the cooling fluid got into the trans fluid probably because trans cooler in the rad and ruined the trans. So the builder added an EXTERNAL trans cooler. So now just a few days ago.....D5 blinking light. But no check engine light and car drives fine. I took the car back to the builder and he said there were no trans codes in the history or anything. I'm so done with this car. I am VERY VERY disappointed in Honda. All the Honda 5sp Autos are pure garbage and they should be ashamed of themselves. Other than the 2 trans I had to replace the car is awesome. But that trans ruins it! I cant believe Honda acting like they have no idea why this is happening. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR!!!! STAY AWAY!!! But an MDX with the new 6spd auto."

Took mine to a great tranny guy who is as honest as can be cause he could have easily said it was the transmission but he didn't.  He found a wire that had been chewed into and replaced it. Total out of my pocket, $75.00.\nEvery now n then it acts like it's in neutral when you give it gas but not often. Now it has motor problems. I was told several causes so I started with the most likely,  catalytic converter.  Bought brand new and replaced. Didn't fix it.  It smokes, uses oil and gas now which is something it never did before.  Nothing happened that I know of to have caused this and a compression check is on the agenda. \nTo sum it up, even tho I love this vehicle, it has been a headache almost from day one.

My son, however, encouraged me to look at an Acura MDX.  Thus, I first test drove the Lexus, but somehow knew what to expect because I have a 1995 ES 300.  I, then humored my son and test drove an Acura.  Well, you guess what my choice was.  The Acura won hands down.   The exterior of the Acura will not catch your attention right away.  It has that low profile image.  But underneath that is the build quality, excellent appointments of the instruments on the dashboard,and of course, its reliability."

There are a lot of automatic extras like auto headlights and wipers and rear-view mirrors that dip when reversing that make owning this car a real joy.  The MDX is also deceptively spacious and sits tall however handles well. Performance is not an issue either but fuel economy kind of is. At an average 13 MPG in the city, you'd think you were driving a GM.  Aside from fuel efficiency (or lack thereof), this is a great family vehicle that looks great even sans-family. The 3rd row is invisible when not in use and it's a Honda so you know it's reliable."

We were pleasantly \nsurprised to discover the Acura MDX.  \nThe build quality is far superior to \nany midsize SUV offered by GM, Ford, or \nChrysler. And, I'm hoping Acura's \nreputation for reliability will help me \nkeep the MDX on the road and out of the \ndealership's garage. The list of \nstandard features is quite lengthy.  If \nyou are looking for a luxury vehicle \nwith a not-so-luxury price, then the \nMDX is for you!  Getcha one!"

Then I found this 2004 with only 88K miles and 'imported' from San Diego to Denver area. What a bulletproof beast she has been for the last year. Pretty heavy travel year, and I'm now at 112K with only great performance. Little bit more money into it after the purchase than I anticipated: timing belt, 105K maintenance, 2 motor mounts, new tires, new leather on the passenger side. But, I love the 3.5, the ride and the performance in the snow ... and great road trip vehicle for 1,000+ mile trips. Probably, the best vehicle I've ever owned -- we'll see. Basically, looks brand new so I expect that I'll get 5-10 years out of it. I agree with all of the positives listed on these reviews. Like the previous Lady's review, if it lasts that long, I'd be happy to keep it to 400K, I feel.\n\nUPDATE 6/20/17:  By the time the 4th of July Holiday is over, I will have put over 40K miles on this 2004 MDX during my 18 months of ownership. I'm happy. Other than the above, the only other things I've handled on this vehicle is having the worn out leather redone on the drivers side.  Change the oil every 5K (uses about a quart), rotate the tires and get it aligned on the unlimited package at Sears. When I get to 150K I'll have the front end redone and replace the sway bar (about $1100). Otherwise, I expect she'll just keep going. Great road-trip vehicle."

The convenience package is adequate neither underwhelming nor overwhelming. The safety features crumple zones, breakaway mounts, full curtain side airbags, etc. are uptodate. Mileage was a paltry 12-13mpg street and 20-25 hwy. For absolute comfort buy the Navigator; for raw power buy the X5. But if you're on a budget and want an all-round SUV that's awesome to drive buy the MDX."

Very perfect vision all around for driving safety.  Good in curves, swerving.  Mirrors great, melt snow.  Tows my boat great, out of steep ramps.  Windshield banked so no chips from rocks.  Fog lights catch deer on dark highway at night for you, safer.  Passes fine.  Pick up fine.  Looks pretty.  Never, never, never screws up.  Have never had to have it fixed.  I have 113,000 miles.

The four \nwheel drive is seemless and the gas \nmileage blows my former X5 away.\nI had to wait for the MDX since it's \nthe most popular SUV in it's class, \nbut trust me, it's so worth it.  \nDollar for dollar, you just can't beat \nit.  It has features that come \nstandard that the X5 just couldn't \ntouch. If you're in NJ, definitely go \nto DCH Montclair Acura."

The driving dynamics are also impressive, with balanced steering (though not X5 level) and sporty handling. I have just 1 problem with the MDX. It's interior may be high quality, but lacks some of the classy-look of the BMW X5. The AWD will make for a sure friend, and the MDX handles much better on snow than Lexus RX330.

The nav screen is smaller, no dual climate control, the buttons on the wheel dont light up, no power up and down feature for driver and passenger windows, and the stereo is anemic in comparison.  This is just nit picking, but the MDX should have the same or better features especially since it is $10K more than the TL.  Despite these very minor issues this is a great SUV.  Space and workmanship are top notch."

    "Review": "This is the best vehicle I've owned. Gas mileage is only 15-17 in the city but much better on the interstate, so it makes up for it. I've had no issues with this vehicle so far it's got 150k and I bought it at 130k so it's still kinda new to me, but it feels very put together and is great on the interstate.  I'm 6'3\" and I gotta say it's about 2 inches short height wise when I'm driving, If I sit all the way up the top of my vision is looking through the very bottom of the factory tint strip on the top where the rearview mirror is glued. So I'd say if you're under 6 feet tall you'll have no problems with this vehicle. Definitely recommend, and it's a unique vehicle not too many on the road because it's a fairly new model , relatively. The Japanese know what they're doing, let's face it why drive anything else when you're going to drop serious coin on a huge machine like this. I'm really glad I bought it, and takes care of everything I need without a pick-up truck payment."

    "Review": "I bought my 2005 MDX from used car lot with 150,000 miles. It sat on the lot for long time, so I picked it up for $6,000.  It was cosmetically beat up, but I wasn't afraid to own it as I have the greatest independent Japanese Auto mechanic.  He said it was mechanically sound.   I'm retired, so I've had time to upgrade:  Suspension, Running Boards, Catalytic Converters, all  LED Lights, Window Regulator, Starter, all dents removed,  reupholstered front seat bottoms myself. It now looks and drives really nice!   It now has 173,000 miles and I've spent a total of $5,000 in maintenance repairs and upgrades.  This SUV hums along like a Japanese Clock!  This is my 3rd MDX of this series (2001 to 2006). Frankly, I occasionally think of getting something sexier or newer, but you just cannot beat the reliability and comfort of this vehicle. Plus, the interior of this SUV is huge.  The newer ones were reduced in size and I don't like the style as much.   I know that my honest mechanic will keep me on the road no matter what. However,  I recommend that everyone should buy  a OBD2 scanner, learn to read codes and research fixes on Youtube.    From what I've read,  I know that a transmission may be in my future.  But,  I'm not worried, as I know a great transmission guy.  At the price I've paid for this car,  I can afford a transmission.  Oh, the AWD is excellent in ice and snow.  I run Bizzaks  on spare wheels in the winter and it never gets stuck.  All round great vehicle and I would drive it anywhere.  Wish gas mileage was better, but then what SUV gets great mileage?  Again, considering the price I paid for the car and I can afford gas."

This was a great buy although I did have to get the transmission replaced at 140,000 but that was the only problem I have had. Also make sure to get the timing belt replaced at the regular intervals, this is an interference engine and the valves will bend if the belt breaks. Great sound system, great room, great comfort, and usability. Buy this car if your in the market for an older luxury SUV with a lot of life left in it! (Quick note, this car does require premium fuel, so take that into account when considering operating costs.) I average about 15 city, 21-22 highway so keep that in mind that gas isn't cheap for this thing."

We paid and kept updated for everything we possibility can. In last 2 years, we have spent for transmission, brakes, spark plug, coil, batteries, tires and brakes, some of these are repeated expenses. Total of approximately $11,000 in last 1 year and she stopped on me again this morning. I wish I had taken a new one instead of investing so much on her. What a rotten piece of machine. Yes I don't have a right to complain because she did fine for the first decade, but what is the point of keeping a constant flow of expenses if this is what we have to deal with."

Overall the wife loves it (even the nav system I had to have) and the kids like being able to have their friends all in one car.  NOTE:  The MDX is due for a redesign in 2007."

As a Real Estate broker I needed a SUV that was confortable in the back as well as the front. The reclining back seats are much better than the straight up and down seating in many other models. The NAV system is the best in fuction of any I have seen. ONSTAR and XM are also a great addition to the older model. The best car I have ever had (my 2001 MDX) got better."

I wanted to buy a 7 passenger seating and was looking at Lexus  GX470 and MBZ ML500. Compared all the vehicles by its features, comfort, gadgets/technologies, options, hp, torque, styling, and value.... with two hands WAY DOWN, MDX came out ahead. There's just no way that MBZ ML500 nor Lexus GX470 could compete. Both MBZ & Lexus's rear/back passenger seats are installed on the side of the trunk space....so inconvenient!  If you want the BEST SUV, MDX is way to go. Don't even waste your time shopping around!"

Sits a little highter than I am used to, and is larger overall - but the interior room is enormous and the rear camera on the Touring is to die for.

    "Review": "Great car after 18 months no complaints at all and no issues at all. Fuel Economy is much better than expected. 23.4 mpg on our last trip to OHIO running 75 mph. Gets 18.6 around town.  Goes great in the snow on trips to the northwoods.  entertainment system and is great. Nav is a little out of date.  My wife will never drive a different suv."

    "Review": "After 18 months, I can't find anything not to like about my MDX.  This is my first Acura and second SUV.  I am a finicky consumer and researched all luxury models prior to buying - it paid off!  For the money, this is by far the best SUV in its class.  Gas mileage was better than anticipated.  And, it has the highest safety/crash test ratings.  Quality, comfort, and value...I love it!"

    "Review": "I have owned a lot of nice vehicles, but the Acura MDX is my favorite vehicle I've ever had!  It does everything well.  I have the navigation system on mine, which I personally would never want to be without again.  Acura has the best one out there, in my opinion.  I test drove a lot of cars and SUVs before I bought this one, and nothing compared. I have had 7 people in my car for a sightseeing trip, and it was wonderful.  I also have had the challenge and fun of driving my MDX through blizzard conditions and on snow-packed, icy steep hills in Pittsburgh, PA, and I went down a very very steep hill in AWD and never even slid.  The vehicle in front of me had gone down the hill sideways!"
